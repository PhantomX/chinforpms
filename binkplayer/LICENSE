We have several options for redistributing Bink files. We have tried to
handle most licensing situations, but it you don't see a license that
works for you - just give us a call. We're happy that you're using Bink,
and we want to make distribution easy!

  1. For non-commerical use, your first distribution option is to
     accompany your Bink files with one of the players from the RAD
     Video Tools. These utilities all display a RAD Game Tools credit.
     You can distribute these utilities for no licensing fees as long
     as you do NOT circumvent this notice and if your use is
     non-commmercial. Any attempt to hide the notice voids your right
     to distribute the files.
  2. The second distribution option is our Bink SDK. With the SDK, you
     have complete control over the entire Bink decompression process.
     The Bink SDK is licensed on a per-product or per-site basis.
  3. Note that, in no case, can you use our Bink encoder for any
     commercial use without a license (whether or not you use our Bink
     decoder player or SDKs). 

Again, we are committed to making distribution easy, so if you have any
questions about the distribution options, just give us a call at
425.893.4300, or drop us an E-mail.
