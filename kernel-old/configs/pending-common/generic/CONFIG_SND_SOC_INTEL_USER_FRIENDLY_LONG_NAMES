# CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_USER_FRIENDLY_LONG_NAMES:
# 
# Some drivers report the I/O configuration to userspace through the
# soundcard's long card name in the control user space AP. An unfortunate
# side effect is that this long name may also be used by the GUI,
# confusing users with information they don't need.
# This option prevents the long name from being modified, and the I/O
# configuration will be provided through a different component interface.
# Select Y if userspace like UCM (Use Case Manager) uses the component
# interface.
# If unsure select N.
# 
# Symbol: SND_SOC_INTEL_USER_FRIENDLY_LONG_NAMES [=n]
# Type  : bool
