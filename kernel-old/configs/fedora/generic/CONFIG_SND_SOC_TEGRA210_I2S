# CONFIG_SND_SOC_TEGRA210_I2S:
# 
# Config to enable the Inter-IC Sound (I2S) Controller which
# implements full-duplex and bidirectional and single direction
# point-to-point serial interfaces. It can interface with I2S
# compatible devices.
# Say Y or M if you want to add support for Tegra210 I2S module.
