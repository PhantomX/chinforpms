# CONFIG_KGDB_HONOUR_BLOCKLIST:
# 
# If set to Y the debug core will use the kprobe blocklist to
# identify symbols where it is unsafe to set breakpoints.
# In particular this disallows instrumentation of functions
# called during debug trap handling and thus makes it very
# difficult to inadvertently provoke recursive trap handling.
# 
# If unsure, say Y.
