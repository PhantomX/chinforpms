# CONFIG_SND_SOC_TEGRA186_DSPK:
# 
# Config to enable the Digital Speaker Controller (DSPK) which
# converts the multi-bit Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) audio input to
# oversampled 1-bit Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) output. From the
# signal flow perspective DSPK can be viewed as a PDM transmitter
# that up-samples the input to the desired sampling rate by
# interpolation and then converts the oversampled PCM input to
# the desired 1-bit output via Delta Sigma Modulation (DSM).
# Say Y or M if you want to add support for Tegra186 DSPK module.
#
