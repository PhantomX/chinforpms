# CONFIG_QCOM_RPMPD:
# 
# QCOM RPM Power domain driver to support power-domains with
# performance states. The driver communicates a performance state
# value to RPM which then translates it into corresponding voltage
# for the voltage rail.

# Symbol: QCOM_RPMPD [=n]
# Type  : tristate
# Defined at drivers/soc/qcom/Kconfig:118
#   Prompt: Qualcomm RPM Power domain driver
