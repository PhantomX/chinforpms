# CONFIG_SND_SOC_TEGRA210_DMIC:
# 
# Config to enable the Digital MIC (DMIC) controller which is used
# to interface with Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) input devices.
# The DMIC controller implements a converter to convert PDM signals
# to Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) signals. This can be viewed as a
# PDM receiver.
# Say Y or M if you want to add support for Tegra210 DMIC module.
