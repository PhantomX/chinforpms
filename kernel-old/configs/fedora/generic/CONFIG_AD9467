# Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices:
# * AD9467 16-Bit, 200 MSPS/250 MSPS Analog-to-Digital Converter
# 
# The driver requires the assistance of the AXI ADC IP core to operate,
# since SPI is used for configuration only, while data has to be
# streamed into memory via DMA.
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
# called ad9467.
