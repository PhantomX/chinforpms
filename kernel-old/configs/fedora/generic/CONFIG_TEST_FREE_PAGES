# CONFIG_TEST_FREE_PAGES:
# 
# Test that a memory leak does not occur due to a race between
# freeing a block of pages and a speculative page reference.
# Loading this module is safe if your kernel has the bug fixed.
# If the bug is not fixed, it will leak gigabytes of memory and
# probably OOM your system.
