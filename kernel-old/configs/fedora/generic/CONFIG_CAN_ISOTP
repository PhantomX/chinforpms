# CONFIG_CAN_ISOTP:
# 
# CAN Transport Protocols offer support for segmented Point-to-Point
# communication between CAN nodes via two defined CAN Identifiers.
# As CAN frames can only transport a small amount of data bytes
# (max. 8 bytes for 'classic' CAN and max. 64 bytes for CAN FD) this
# segmentation is needed to transport longer PDUs as needed e.g. for
# vehicle diagnosis (UDS, ISO 14229) or IP-over-CAN traffic.
# This protocol driver implements data transfers according to
# ISO 15765-2:2016 for 'classic' CAN and CAN FD frame types.
# If you want to perform automotive vehicle diagnostic services (UDS),
# say 'y'.
# 
# Symbol: CAN_ISOTP [=n]
