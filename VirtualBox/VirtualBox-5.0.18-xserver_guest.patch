The MIT License is to allow be in included in VirtualBox source code.

Using also VBOX_USE_SYSTEM_XORG_HEADERS to build guest additions parts,
just compile with X11 system source and we may remove all bundle X11 source code.

when we use VBOX_USE_SYSTEM_XORG_HEADERS, we don't need compile the very old
VBoxGuestR3LibXFree86 for use with old servers where the C library is not
available and becasue fail to build when we unbundle all X11 sources, files like
xf86_ansic.h doesn't exist anymore.
