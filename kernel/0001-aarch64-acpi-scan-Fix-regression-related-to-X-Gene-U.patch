Commit e361d1f85855 ("ACPI / scan: Fix enumeration for special UART
devices") caused a regression with some X-Gene based platforms (Mustang
and M400) with invalid DSDT. The DSDT makes it appear that the UART
device is also a slave device attached to itself. With the above commit
the UART won't be enumerated by ACPI scan (slave serial devices shouldn't
be). So check for X-Gene UART device and skip slace device check on it.
