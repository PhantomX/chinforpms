Subject: [PATCH] Vulcan: AHCI PCI bar fix for Broadcom Vulcan early silicon

Message-id: <1528412373-19128-2-git-send-email-rrichter@redhat.com>
Patchwork-id: 220950
O-Subject: [RHEL-8.0 BZ 1563590 v2 1/2] PCI: Vulcan: AHCI PCI bar fix for Broadcom Vulcan early silicon
Bugzilla: 1563590

From: Ashok Kumar Sekar <asekar@redhat.com>

PCI BAR 5 is not setup correctly for the on-board AHCI
controller on Broadcom's Vulcan processor. Added a quirk to fix BAR 5
by using BAR 4's resources which are populated correctly but NOT used
by the AHCI controller actually.

RHEL-only:

Both patches are in RHEL-7.6 also. Inclusion of the patches into RHEL-8
was discussed. Since there are partners with Ax system configurations it
was decided to carry them in RHEL8 too. See:
