Subject: [PATCH] arm: aarch64: Drop the EXPERT setting from ARM64_FORCE_52BIT

Message-id: <20191001181256.22935-1-jcline@redhat.com>
Patchwork-id: 275498
O-Subject: [ARK INTERNAL PATCH] [ARK INTERNAL PATCH] [redhat] Add patch
    to drop the EXPERT setting from ARM64_FORCE_52BIT
Bugzilla:
RH-Acked-by: Laura Abbott <labbott@redhat.com>

We don't turn on EXPERT as there are few settings we actually want to
mess with. Remove the dependency for ARM64_FORCE_52BIT as we do want
that on in debug builds to help find 52-bit bugs.
