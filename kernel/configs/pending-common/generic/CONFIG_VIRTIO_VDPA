# CONFIG_VIRTIO_VDPA:
# 
# This driver provides support for virtio based paravirtual
# device driver over vDPA bus. For this to be useful, you need
# an appropriate vDPA device implementation that operates on a
# physical device to allow the datapath of virtio to be
# offloaded to hardware.
# 
# If unsure, say M.
