# CONFIG_HIST_TRIGGERS_DEBUG:
# 
# Add "hist_debug" file for each event, which when read will
# dump out a bunch of internal details about the hist triggers
# defined on that event.
# 
# The hist_debug file serves a couple of purposes:
# 
#   - Helps developers verify that nothing is broken.
# 
#   - Provides educational information to support the details
#     of the hist trigger internals as described by
#     Documentation/trace/histogram-design.rst.
# 
# The hist_debug output only covers the data structures
# related to the histogram definitions themselves and doesn't
# display the internals of map buckets or variable values of
# running histograms.
# 
# If unsure, say N.
# 
# Symbol: HIST_TRIGGERS_DEBUG [=n]
