# CONFIG_IIO_BUFFER_DMAENGINE:
# 
# Provides a bonding of the generic IIO DMA buffer infrastructure with the
# DMAEngine framework. This can be used by converter drivers with a DMA port
# connected to an external DMA controller which is supported by the
# DMAEngine framework.
# 
# Should be selected by drivers that want to use this functionality.
# 
# Symbol: IIO_BUFFER_DMAENGINE [=n]
# Type  : tristate
# Defined at drivers/iio/buffer/Kconfig:22
#   Prompt: Industrial I/O DMA buffer integration with DMAEngine
