# CONFIG_USB4_DMA_TEST:
# 
# This allows sending and receiving DMA traffic through loopback
# connection. Loopback connection can be done by either special
# dongle that has TX/RX lines crossed, or by simply connecting a
# cable back to the host. Only enable this if you know what you
# are doing. Normal users and distro kernels should say N here.
# 
# To compile this driver a module, choose M here. The module will be
# called thunderbolt_dma_test.
