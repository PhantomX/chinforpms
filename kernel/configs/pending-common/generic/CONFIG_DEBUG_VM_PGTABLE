# CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE:
# 
# This option provides a debug method which can be used to test
# architecture page table helper functions on various platforms in
# verifying if they comply with expected generic MM semantics. This
# will help architecture code in making sure that any changes or
# new additions of these helpers still conform to expected
# semantics of the generic MM. Platforms will have to opt in for
# this through ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE.
# 
# If unsure, say N.
