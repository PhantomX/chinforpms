# CONFIG_ARM64_BTI:
# 
# Branch Target Identification (part of the ARMv8.5 Extensions)
# provides a mechanism to limit the set of locations to which computed
# branch instructions such as BR or BLR can jump.
# 
# To make use of BTI on CPUs that support it, say Y.
# 
# BTI is intended to provide complementary protection to other control
# flow integrity protection mechanisms, such as the Pointer
# authentication mechanism provided as part of the ARMv8.3 Extensions.
# For this reason, it does not make sense to enable this option without
# also enabling support for pointer authentication.  Thus, when
# enabling this option you should also select ARM64_PTR_AUTH=y.
# 
# Userspace binaries must also be specifically compiled to make use of
# this mechanism.  If you say N here or the hardware does not support
# BTI, such binaries can still run, but you get no additional
# enforcement of branch destinations.
