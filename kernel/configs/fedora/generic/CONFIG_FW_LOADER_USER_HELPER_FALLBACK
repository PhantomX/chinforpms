# CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK:
# 
# Enabling this option forces a sysfs userspace fallback mechanism
# to be used for all firmware requests which explicitly do not disable a
# a fallback mechanism. Firmware calls which do prohibit a fallback
# mechanism is request_firmware_direct(). This option is kept for
# backward compatibility purposes given this precise mechanism can also
# be enabled by setting the proc sysctl value to true:
# 
#      /proc/sys/kernel/firmware_config/force_sysfs_fallback
# 
# If you are unsure about this, say N here.
