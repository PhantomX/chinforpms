# CONFIG_MTD_SPI_NOR_SWP_DISABLE:
# 
# This option disables the software write protection on any SPI
# flashes at boot-up.
# 
# Depending on the flash chip this either clears the block protection
# bits or does a "Global Unprotect" command.
# 
# Don't use this if you intent to use the software write protection
# of your SPI flash. This is only to keep backwards compatibility.
