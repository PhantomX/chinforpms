# CONFIG_PWM_ATMEL_TCB:
# 
# Generic PWM framework driver for Atmel Timer Counter Block.
# 
# A Timer Counter Block provides 6 PWM devices grouped by 2.
# Devices in a given group must have the same period.
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
# will be called pwm-atmel-tcb.
# 
# Symbol: PWM_ATMEL_TCB [=n]
# Type  : tristate
# Defined at drivers/pwm/Kconfig:76
#   Prompt: Atmel TC Block PWM support
#   Depends on: PWM [=y] && OF [=y]
#   Location:
#     -> Device Drivers
#       -> Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Support (PWM [=y])
# Selects: REGMAP_MMIO [=y]
