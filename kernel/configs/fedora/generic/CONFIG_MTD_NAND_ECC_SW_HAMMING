# CONFIG_MTD_NAND_ECC_SW_HAMMING:
# 
# This enables support for software Hamming error
# correction. This correction can correct up to 1 bit error
# per chunk and detect up to 2 bit errors. While it used to be
# widely used with old parts, newer NAND chips usually require
# more strength correction and in this case BCH or RS will be
# preferred.
