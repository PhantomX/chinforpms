# CONFIG_IPQ_APSS_PLL:
# 
# Support for APSS PLL on ipq devices. The APSS PLL is the main
# clock that feeds the CPUs on ipq based devices.
# Say Y if you want to support CPU frequency scaling on ipq based
# devices.
# 
# Symbol: IPQ_APSS_PLL [=n]
# Type  : tristate
# Defined at drivers/clk/qcom/Kconfig:101
#   Prompt: IPQ APSS PLL
