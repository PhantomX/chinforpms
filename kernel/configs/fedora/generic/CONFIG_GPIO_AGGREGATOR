# CONFIG_GPIO_AGGREGATOR:
# 
# Say yes here to enable the GPIO Aggregator, which provides a way to
# aggregate existing GPIO lines into a new virtual GPIO chip.
# This can serve the following purposes:
#   - Assign permissions for a collection of GPIO lines to a user,
#   - Export a collection of GPIO lines to a virtual machine,
#   - Provide a generic driver for a GPIO-operated device in an
#     industrial control context, to be operated from userspace using
#     the GPIO chardev interface.
#
