# CONFIG_GUP_TEST:
# 
# Provides /sys/kernel/debug/gup_test, which in turn provides a way
# to make ioctl calls that can launch kernel-based unit tests for
# the get_user_pages*() and pin_user_pages*() family of API calls.
# 
# These tests include benchmark testing of the _fast variants of
# get_user_pages*() and pin_user_pages*(), as well as smoke tests of
# the non-_fast variants.
# 
# There is also a sub-test that allows running dump_page() on any
# of up to eight pages (selected by command line args) within the
# range of user-space addresses. These pages are either pinned via
# pin_user_pages*(), or pinned via get_user_pages*(), as specified
# by other command line arguments.
