# CONFIG_RING_BUFFER_VALIDATE_TIME_DELTAS:
# 
# This will audit the time stamps on the ring buffer sub
# buffer to make sure that all the time deltas for the
# events on a sub buffer matches the current time stamp.
# This audit is performed for every event that is not
# interrupted, or interrupting another event. A check
# is also made when traversing sub buffers to make sure
# that all the deltas on the previous sub buffer do not
# add up to be greater than the current time stamp.
# 
# NOTE: This adds significant overhead to recording of events,
# and should only be used to test the logic of the ring buffer.
# Do not use it on production systems.
# 
# Only say Y if you understand what this does, and you
# still want it enabled. Otherwise say N
