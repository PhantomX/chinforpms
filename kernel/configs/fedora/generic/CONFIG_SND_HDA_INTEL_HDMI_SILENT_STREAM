# CONFIG_SND_HDA_INTEL_HDMI_SILENT_STREAM:
# 
# Intel hardware has a feature called 'silent stream', that
# keeps external HDMI receiver's analog circuitry powered on
# avoiding 2-3 sec silence during playback start. This mechanism
# relies on setting channel_id as 0xf, sending info packet and
# preventing codec D3 entry (increasing  platform static power
# consumption when HDMI receiver is plugged-in). 2-3 sec silence
# at the playback start is expected whenever there is format change.
# (default is 2 channel format).
# Say Y to enable Silent Stream feature.
# 
# Symbol: SND_HDA_INTEL_HDMI_SILENT_STREAM [=n]
