Subject: [PATCH] Kbuild: Add an option to enable GCC VTA
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Due to recent codegen issues, gcc -fvar-tracking-assignments was
unconditionally disabled in commit 2062afb4f804a ("Fix gcc-4.9.0
miscompilation of load_balance() in scheduler").  However, this reduces
the debuginfo coverage for variable locations, especially in inline
functions.  VTA is certainly not perfect either in those cases, but it
is much better than without.  With compiler versions that have fixed the
codegen bugs, we would prefer to have the better details for SystemTap,
and surely other debuginfo consumers like perf will benefit as well.

This patch simply makes CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_VTA an option.  I considered
Frank and Linus's discussion of a cc-option-like -fcompare-debug test,
but I'm convinced that a narrow test of an arch-specific codegen issue
is not really useful.  GCC has their own regression tests for this, so
I'd suggest GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG=-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle is more
useful for kernel developers to test confidence.

In fact, I ran into a couple more issues when testing for this patch[1],
although neither of those had any codegen impact.

With gcc-4.9.2-1.fc22, I can now build v3.18-rc5 with Fedora's i686 and
x86_64 configs, and this is completely clean with GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG.
