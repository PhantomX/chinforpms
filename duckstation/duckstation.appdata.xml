 <description>
  <p>
   DuckStation is an simulator/emulator of the Sony PlayStation(TM) console,
   focusing on playability, speed, and long-term maintainability. The goal is to
   be as accurate as possible while maintaining performance suitable for low-end
   devices. "Hack" options are discouraged, the default configuration should
   support all playable games with only some of the enhancements having
   compatibility issues.
