    <p>
    Barrier is software that mimics the functionality of a KVM switch, which
    historically would allow you to use a single keyboard and mouse to control
    multiple computers by physically turning a dial on the box to switch the machine
    you're controlling at any given moment. Barrier does this in software, allowing
    you to tell it which machine to control by moving your mouse to the edge of the
    screen, or by using a keypress to switch focus to a different system.
