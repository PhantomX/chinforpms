We don't need compile the very old VBoxGuestR3LibXFree86, latest XFree86/X windows
server was release is dated of 2007 and because fail to build when
we unbundle all X11 sources, files like xf86_ansic.h no longer doesn't exist.
The question is if we use VBOX_USE_SYSTEM_XORG_HEADERS or
VBOX_USE_SYSTEM_GL_HEADERS or VBOX_NO_LEGACY_XORG_X11

/usr/include/x11 never existed we only have /usr/include/X11 (with capital X),
IIRC was I that introduce this typo (when we added VBOX_USE_SYSTEM_XORG_HEADERS)
