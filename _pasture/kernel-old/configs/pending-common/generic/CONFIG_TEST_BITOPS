# CONFIG_TEST_BITOPS:
# 
# This builds the "test_bitops" module that is much like the
# TEST_LKM module except that it does a basic exercise of the
# clear_bit and set_bit macros to make sure there are no compiler
# warnings from C=1 sparse checker or -Wextra compilations. It has
# no dependencies and doesn't run or load unless explicitly requested
# by name.  for example: modprobe test_bitops.
# 
# If unsure, say N.
