# CONFIG_FLATMEM_MANUAL:
# 
# This option is best suited for non-NUMA systems with
# flat address space. The FLATMEM is the most efficient
# system in terms of performance and resource consumption
# and it is the best option for smaller systems.
# 
# For systems that have holes in their physical address
# spaces and for features like NUMA and memory hotplug,
# choose "Sparse Memory".
# 
# If unsure, choose this option (Flat Memory) over any other.
