# CONFIG_RCU_SCALE_TEST:
# 
# This option provides a kernel module that runs performance
# tests on the RCU infrastructure.  The kernel module may be built
# after the fact on the running kernel to be tested, if desired.
# 
# Say Y here if you want RCU performance tests to be built into
# the kernel.
# Say M if you want the RCU performance tests to build as a module.
# Say N if you are unsure.
