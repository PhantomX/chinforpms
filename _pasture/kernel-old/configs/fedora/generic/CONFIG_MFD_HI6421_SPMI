# CONFIG_MFD_HI6421_SPMI:
# 
# Add support for HiSilicon Hi6421v600 SPMI PMIC. Hi6421 includes
# multi-functions, such as regulators, RTC, codec, Coulomb counter,
# etc.
# 
# This driver includes core APIs _only_. You have to select
# individual components like voltage regulators under corresponding
# menus in order to enable them.
# We communicate with the Hi6421v600 via a SPMI bus.
