# 
# If you say yes here you get support for the AMS AS73211
# JENCOLOR(R) Digital XYZ Sensor.

# For triggered measurements, you will need an additional trigger driver
# like IIO_HRTIMER_TRIGGER or IIO_SYSFS_TRIGGER.
# 
# This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
# will be called as73211.
