# CONFIG_DPTF_PCH_FIVR:
# 
# This driver adds support for Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework
# (DPTF) PCH FIVR Participant device support. This driver allows to
# switch PCH FIVR (Fully Integrated Voltage Regulator) frequency.
# This participant is responsible for exposing:
#       freq_mhz_low_clock
#       freq_mhz_high_clock
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
# the module will be called dptf_pch_fivr.
# 
# Symbol: DPTF_PCH_FIVR [=n]
