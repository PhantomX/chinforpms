# CONFIG_XFS_SUPPORT_V4:
# 
# The V4 filesystem format lacks certain features that are supported
# by the V5 format, such as metadata checksumming, strengthened
# metadata verification, and the ability to store timestamps past the
# year 2038.  Because of this, the V4 format is deprecated.  All users
# should upgrade by backing up their files, reformatting, and restoring
# from the backup.
# 
# Administrators and users can detect a V4 filesystem by running
# xfs_info against a filesystem mountpoint and checking for a string
# beginning with "crc=".  If the string "crc=0" is found, the
# filesystem is a V4 filesystem.  If no such string is found, please
# upgrade xfsprogs to the latest version and try again.
# 
# This option will become default N in September 2025.  Support for the
# V4 format will be removed entirely in September 2030.  Distributors
# can say N here to withdraw support earlier.
# 
# To continue supporting the old V4 format (crc=0), say Y.
# To close off an attack surface, say N.
