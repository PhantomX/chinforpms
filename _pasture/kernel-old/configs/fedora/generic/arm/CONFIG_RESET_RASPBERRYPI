# CONFIG_RESET_RASPBERRYPI:
# 
# Raspberry Pi 4's co-processor controls some of the board's HW
# initialization process, but it's up to Linux to trigger it when
# relevant. This driver provides a reset controller capable of
# interfacing with RPi4's co-processor and model these firmware
# initialization routines as reset lines.
