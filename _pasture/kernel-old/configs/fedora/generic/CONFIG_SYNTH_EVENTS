# CONFIG_SYNTH_EVENTS:
# 
# Synthetic events are user-defined trace events that can be
# used to combine data from other trace events or in fact any
# data source.  Synthetic events can be generated indirectly
# via the trace() action of histogram triggers or directly
# by way of an in-kernel API.
# 
# See Documentation/trace/events.rst or
# Documentation/trace/histogram.rst for details and examples.
# 
# If in doubt, say N.
