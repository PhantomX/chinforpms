# CONFIG_SND_INTEL_BYT_PREFER_SOF:
# 
# The kernel has 2 drivers for the Low Power Engine audio-block on
# Bay- and Cherry-Trail SoCs. The old SST driver and the new SOF
# driver. If both drivers are enabled then the kernel will default
# to using the old SST driver, unless told otherwise through the
# snd_intel_dspcfg.dsp_driver module-parameter.
# 
# Set this option to Y to make the kernel default to the new SOF
# driver instead.
# 
# Symbol: SND_INTEL_BYT_PREFER_SOF [=n]
# Type  : bool
# Defined at sound/hda/Kconfig:50
#   Prompt: Prefer SOF driver over SST on BY/CHT platforms
#   Depends on: SOUND [=m] && !UML && SND [=m] && SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM_ACPI [=m] && SND_SOC_SOF_BAYTRAIL [=m]

# Note there were plans to enable this by default for F34+ :
# https://fedoraproject.org/w/index.php?title=Changes/SofDefaultForIntelLpe
# But there are still too many issues with the new SOF driver, so keep this disabled:
