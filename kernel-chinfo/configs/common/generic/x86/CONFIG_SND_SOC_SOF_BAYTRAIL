# CONFIG_SND_SOC_SOF_BAYTRAIL:
# 
# This adds support for Sound Open Firmware for Intel(R) platforms
# using the Baytrail, Braswell or Cherrytrail processors.
# This option can coexist in the same build with the Atom legacy
# drivers, currently the default but which will be deprecated
# at some point.
# Existing firmware/topology binaries and UCM configurations
# typically located in the root file system are already
# compatible with both SOF or Atom/SST legacy drivers.
# This is a recommended option for distributions.
# Say Y if you want to enable SOF on Baytrail/Cherrytrail.
# If unsure select "N".
