# CONFIG_MLX5_CLS_ACT:
# 
# mlx5 ConnectX offloads support for TC classifier action (NET_CLS_ACT),
# works in both native NIC mode and Switchdev SRIOV mode.
# Actions get attached to a Hardware offloaded classifiers and are
# invoked after a successful classification. Actions are used to
# overwrite the classification result, instantly drop or redirect and/or
# reformat packets in wire speeds without involving the host cpu.
# 
# If set to N, TC offloads in both NIC and switchdev modes will be disabled.
# If unsure, set to Y
