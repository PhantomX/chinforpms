# CONFIG_VIRTIO_MEM:
# 
# This driver provides access to virtio-mem paravirtualized memory
# devices, allowing to hotplug and hotunplug memory.
# 
# This driver was only tested under x86-64, but should theoretically
# work on all architectures that support memory hotplug and hotremove.
# 
# If unsure, say M.

# Symbol: VIRTIO_MEM [=m]
