# CONFIG_FTRACE_RECORD_RECURSION:
# 
# All callbacks that attach to the function tracing have some sort
# of protection against recursion. Even though the protection exists,
# it adds overhead. This option will create a file in the tracefs
# file system called "recursed_functions" that will list the functions
# that triggered a recursion.
# 
# This will add more overhead to cases that have recursion.
# 
# If unsure, say N
