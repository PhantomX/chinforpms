# CONFIG_MTD_NAND_ECC_SW_BCH:
# 
# This enables support for software BCH error correction. Binary BCH
# codes are more powerful and cpu intensive than traditional Hamming
# ECC codes. They are used with NAND devices requiring more than 1 bit
# of error correction.
# 
# Symbol: MTD_NAND_ECC_SW_BCH [=n]
# Type  : bool
# Defined at drivers/mtd/nand/Kconfig:38
#   Prompt: Software BCH ECC engine
