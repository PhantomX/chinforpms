# CONFIG_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR:
# 
# Say Y here to enable the kernel to act as a watchdog to detect
# hard lockups.
# 
# Hardlockups are bugs that cause the CPU to loop in kernel mode
# for more than 10 seconds, without letting other interrupts have a
# chance to run.  The current stack trace is displayed upon detection
# and the system will stay locked up.
#
