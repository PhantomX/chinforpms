# CONFIG_INPUT_DA7280_HAPTICS:
# 
# Say Y to enable support for the Dialog DA7280 haptics driver.
# The haptics can be controlled by PWM or GPIO
# with I2C communication.
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
# module will be called da7280.

# Symbol: INPUT_DA7280_HAPTICS [=n]
