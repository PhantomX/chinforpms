# CONFIG_IP_VS_TWOS:
# 
# The weighted random twos choice least-connection scheduling
# algorithm picks two random real servers and directs network
# connections to the server with the least active connections
# normalized by the server weight.
# 
# If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. To compile it as a
# module, choose M here. If unsure, say N.
