# CONFIG_KFENCE_STATIC_KEYS:
# 
# Use static keys (static branches) to set up KFENCE allocations. Using
# static keys is normally recommended, because it avoids a dynamic
# branch in the allocator's fast path. However, with very low sample
# intervals, or on systems that do not support jump labels, a dynamic
# branch may still be an acceptable performance trade-off.
