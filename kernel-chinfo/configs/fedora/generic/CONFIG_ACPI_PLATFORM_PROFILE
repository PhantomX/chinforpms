# 
# This driver adds support for platform-profiles on platforms that
# support it.

# example whether to operate in a lower power mode, in a higher
# power performance mode or between the two.
#

# point for platform specific drivers.

# Which profiles are supported is determined on a per-platform basis and
# should be obtained from the platform specific driver.
