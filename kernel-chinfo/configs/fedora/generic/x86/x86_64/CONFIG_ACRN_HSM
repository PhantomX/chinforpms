# CONFIG_ACRN_HSM:
# 
# ACRN Hypervisor Service Module (HSM) is a kernel module which
# communicates with ACRN userspace through ioctls and talks to
# the ACRN Hypervisor through hypercalls. HSM will only run in
# a privileged management VM, called Service VM, to manage User
# VMs and do I/O emulation. Not required for simply running
# under ACRN as a User VM.
# 
# To compile as a module, choose M, the module will be called
# acrn. If unsure, say N.
