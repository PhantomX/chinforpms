# CONFIG_INTEL_TCC_COOLING:
# 
# Enable this to support system cooling by adjusting the effective TCC
# activation temperature via the TCC Offset register, which is widely
# supported on modern Intel platforms.
# Note that, on different platforms, the behavior might be different
# on how fast the setting takes effect, and how much the CPU frequency
# is reduced.
