# Say yes here to have support for Basin Cove power management IC (PMIC) ADC
# device. Depending on platform configuration, this general purpose ADC can
# be used for sampling sensors such as thermal resistors.
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
# called intel_mrfld_adc.
