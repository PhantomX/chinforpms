# CONFIG_MTD_SPI_NOR_SWP_DISABLE_ON_VOLATILE:
# 
# Some SPI flashes have volatile block protection bits, ie. after a
# power-up or a reset the flash is software write protected by
# default.
# 
# This option disables the software write protection for these kind
# of flashes while keeping it enabled for any other SPI flashes
# which have non-volatile write protection bits.
# 
# If the software write protection will be disabled depending on
# the flash either the block protection bits are cleared or a
# "Global Unprotect" command is issued.
# 
# If you are unsure, select this option.
