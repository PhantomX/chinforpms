# CONFIG_CXL_BUS:
# 
# CXL is a bus that is electrically compatible with PCI Express, but
# layers three protocols on that signalling (CXL.io, CXL.cache, and
# CXL.mem). The CXL.cache protocol allows devices to hold cachelines
# locally, the CXL.mem protocol allows devices to be fully coherent
# memory targets, the CXL.io protocol is equivalent to PCI Express.
# Say 'y' to enable support for the configuration and management of
# devices supporting these protocols.
# 
# Symbol: CXL_BUS [=n]
# Type  : tristate
# Defined at drivers/cxl/Kconfig:2
#   Prompt: CXL (Compute Express Link) Devices Support
#   Depends on: PCI [=y]
#   Location:
#     -> Device Drivers
#       -> PCI support (PCI [=y])
