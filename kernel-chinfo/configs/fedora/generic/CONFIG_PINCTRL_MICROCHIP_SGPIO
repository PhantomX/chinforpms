# CONFIG_PINCTRL_MICROCHIP_SGPIO:
# 
# Support for the serial GPIO interface used on Microsemi and
# Microchip SoC's. By using a serial interface, the SIO
# controller significantly extends the number of available
# GPIOs with a minimum number of additional pins on the
# device. The primary purpose of the SIO controller is to
# connect control signals from SFP modules and to act as an
# LED controller.
# 
# Symbol: PINCTRL_MICROCHIP_SGPIO [=n]
