# CONFIG_SENSORS_INTEL_M10_BMC_HWMON:
# 
# This driver provides support for the hardware monitoring functionality
# on Intel MAX10 BMC chip.
# 
# This BMC Chip is used on Intel FPGA PCIe Acceleration Cards (PAC). Its
# sensors monitor various telemetry data of different components on the
# card, e.g. board temperature, FPGA core temperature/voltage/current.
# 
# Symbol: SENSORS_INTEL_M10_BMC_HWMON [=n]
