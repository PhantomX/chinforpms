# CONFIG_X86_SGX:
# 
# Intel(R) Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) is a set of CPU instructions
# that can be used by applications to set aside private regions of code
# and data, referred to as enclaves. An enclave's private memory can
# only be accessed by code running within the enclave. Accesses from
# outside the enclave, including other enclaves, are disallowed by
# hardware.
