# CONFIG_RCU_REF_SCALE_TEST:
# 
# This option provides a kernel module that runs performance tests
# useful comparing RCU with various read-side synchronization mechanisms.
# The kernel module may be built after the fact on the running kernel to be
# tested, if desired.
# 
# Say Y here if you want these performance tests built into the kernel.
# Say M if you want to build it as a module instead.
# Say N if you are unsure.
# 
# Symbol: RCU_REF_SCALE_TEST [=n]
