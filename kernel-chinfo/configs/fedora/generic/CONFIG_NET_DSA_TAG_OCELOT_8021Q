# Say Y or M if you want to enable support for tagging frames with a
# custom VLAN-based header. Frames that require timestamping, such as
# PTP, are not delivered over Ethernet but over register-based MMIO.
# Flow control over the CPU port is functional in this mode. When using
# this mode, less TCAM resources (VCAP IS1, IS2, ES0) are available for
# use with tc-flower.
