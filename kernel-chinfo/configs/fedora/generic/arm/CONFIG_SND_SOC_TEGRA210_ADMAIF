# CONFIG_SND_SOC_TEGRA210_ADMAIF:
# 
# Config to enable ADMAIF which is the interface between ADMA and
# Audio Hub (AHUB). Each ADMA channel that sends/receives data to/
# from AHUB must interface through an ADMAIF channel. ADMA channel
# sending data to AHUB pairs with an ADMAIF Tx channel, where as
# ADMA channel receiving data from AHUB pairs with an ADMAIF Rx
# channel. Buffer size is configurable for each ADMAIIF channel.
# Say Y or M if you want to add support for Tegra210 ADMAIF module.
