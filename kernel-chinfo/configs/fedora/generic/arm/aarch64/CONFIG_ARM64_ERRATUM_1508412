# CONFIG_ARM64_ERRATUM_1508412:
# 
# This option adds a workaround for Arm Cortex-A77 erratum 1508412.
# 
# Affected Cortex-A77 cores (r0p0, r1p0) could deadlock on a sequence
# of a store-exclusive or read of PAR_EL1 and a load with device or
# non-cacheable memory attributes. The workaround depends on a firmware
# counterpart.
# 
# KVM guests must also have the workaround implemented or they can
# deadlock the system.
# 
# Work around the issue by inserting DMB SY barriers around PAR_EL1
# register reads and warning KVM users. The DMB barrier is sufficient
# to prevent a speculative PAR_EL1 read.
# 
# If unsure, say Y.
# 
# Symbol: ARM64_ERRATUM_1508412 [=y]
