# CONFIG_ARM_GT_INITIAL_PRESCALER_VAL:
# 
# When the ARM global timer initializes, its current rate is declared
# to the kernel and maintained forever. Should it's parent clock
# change, the driver tries to fix the timer's internal prescaler.
# On some machs (i.e. Zynq) the initial prescaler value thus poses
# bounds about how much the parent clock is allowed to decrease or
# increase wrt the initial clock value.
# This affects CPU_FREQ max delta from the initial frequency.
# 
# Symbol: ARM_GT_INITIAL_PRESCALER_VAL [=2]
# Type  : integer
# Defined at drivers/clocksource/Kconfig:361
