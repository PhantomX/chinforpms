# CONFIG_KFENCE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL:
# 
# The KFENCE sample interval determines the frequency with which heap
# allocations will be guarded by KFENCE. May be overridden via boot
# parameter "kfence.sample_interval".
# 
# Set this to 0 to disable KFENCE by default, in which case only
# setting "kfence.sample_interval" to a non-zero value enables KFENCE.
#
