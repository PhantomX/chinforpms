# CONFIG_SECURITY_LANDLOCK:
# 
# Landlock is a sandboxing mechanism that enables processes to restrict
# themselves (and their future children) by gradually enforcing
# tailored access control policies.  A Landlock security policy is a
# set of access rights (e.g. open a file in read-only, make a
# directory, etc.) tied to a file hierarchy.  Such policy can be
# configured and enforced by any processes for themselves using the
# dedicated system calls: landlock_create_ruleset(),
# landlock_add_rule(), and landlock_restrict_self().
# 
# See Documentation/userspace-api/landlock.rst for further information.
# 
# If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.  Otherwise,
# you should also prepend "landlock," to the content of CONFIG_LSM to
# enable Landlock at boot time.
