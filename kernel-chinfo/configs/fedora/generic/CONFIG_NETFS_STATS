# CONFIG_NETFS_STATS:
# 
# This option causes statistical information to be gathered on local
# caching and exported through file:
# 
#       /proc/fs/fscache/stats
# 
# The gathering of statistics adds a certain amount of overhead to
# execution as there are a quite a few stats gathered, and on a
# multi-CPU system these may be on cachelines that keep bouncing
# between CPUs.  On the other hand, the stats are very useful for
# debugging purposes.  Saying 'Y' here is recommended.
