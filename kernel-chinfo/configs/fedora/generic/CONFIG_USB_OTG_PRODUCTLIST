# CONFIG_USB_OTG_PRODUCTLIST:

# If you say Y here, the "otg_productlist.h" file will be used as a
# product list, so USB peripherals not listed there will be
# rejected during enumeration.  This behavior is required by the
# USB OTG and EH specification for all devices not on your product's
# "Targeted Peripherals List".  "Embedded Hosts" are likewise
# allowed to support only a limited number of peripherals.
