# CONFIG_UIO_DFL:
# 
# Generic DFL (Device Feature List) driver for Userspace I/O devices.
# It is useful to provide direct access to DFL devices from userspace.
# A sample userspace application using this driver is available for
# download in a git repository:
# 
#   git clone https://github.com/OPAE/opae-sdk.git
# 
# It could be found at:
# 
#   opae-sdk/tools/libopaeuio/
# 
# If you compile this as a module, it will be called uio_dfl.
# Symbol: UIO_DFL [=n]
