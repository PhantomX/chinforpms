# CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF5:
# 
# Generate DWARF v5 debug info. Requires binutils 2.35.2, gcc 5.0+ (gcc
# 5.0+ accepts the -gdwarf-5 flag but only had partial support for some
# draft features until 7.0), and gdb 8.0+.
# 
# Changes to the structure of debug info in Version 5 allow for around
# 15-18% savings in resulting image and debug info section sizes as
# compared to DWARF Version 4. DWARF Version 5 standardizes previous
# extensions such as accelerators for symbol indexing and the format
# for fission (.dwo/.dwp) files. Users may not want to select this
# config if they rely on tooling that has not yet been updated to
# support DWARF Version 5.
