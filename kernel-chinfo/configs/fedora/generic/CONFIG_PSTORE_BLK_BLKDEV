# CONFIG_PSTORE_BLK_BLKDEV:
# 
# Which block device should be used for pstore/blk.
# 
# It accepts the following variants:
# 1) <hex_major><hex_minor> device number in hexadecimal representation,
#    with no leading 0x, for example b302.
# 2) /dev/<disk_name> represents the device name of disk
# 3) /dev/<disk_name><decimal> represents the device name and number
#    of partition - device number of disk plus the partition number
# 4) /dev/<disk_name>p<decimal> - same as the above, this form is
#    used when disk name of partitioned disk ends with a digit.
# 5) PARTUUID=00112233-4455-6677-8899-AABBCCDDEEFF representing the
#    unique id of a partition if the partition table provides it.
#    The UUID may be either an EFI/GPT UUID, or refer to an MSDOS
#    partition using the format SSSSSSSS-PP, where SSSSSSSS is a zero-
#    filled hex representation of the 32-bit "NT disk signature", and PP
#    is a zero-filled hex representation of the 1-based partition number.
# 6) PARTUUID=<UUID>/PARTNROFF=<int> to select a partition in relation
#    to a partition with a known unique id.
# 7) <major>:<minor> major and minor number of the device separated by
#    a colon.
# 
# NOTE that, both Kconfig and module parameters can configure
# pstore/blk, but module parameters have priority over Kconfig.
