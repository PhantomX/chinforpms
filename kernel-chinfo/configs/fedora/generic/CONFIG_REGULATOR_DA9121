# Say y here to support for the Dialog Semiconductor DA9121.  The
# DA9121 is a single channel dual-phase buck converter controlled
# through an I2C interface.
# 
# DA9121 Single-channel dual-phase 10A buck converter
# DA9130 Single-channel dual-phase 10A buck converter (Automotive)
# DA9217 Single-channel dual-phase  6A buck converter
# DA9122 Dual-channel single-phase  5A buck converter
# DA9131 Dual-channel single-phase  5A buck converter (Automotive)
# DA9220 Dual-channel single-phase  3A buck converter
# DA9132 Dual-channel single-phase  3A buck converter (Automotive)
# 
# This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
# will be called da9121-regulator.
