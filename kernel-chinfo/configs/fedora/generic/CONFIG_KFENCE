# CONFIG_KFENCE:
# 
# KFENCE is a low-overhead sampling-based detector of heap out-of-bounds
# access, use-after-free, and invalid-free errors. KFENCE is designed
# to have negligible cost to permit enabling it in production
# environments.
# 
# See <file:Documentation/dev-tools/kfence.rst> for more details.
# 
# Note that, KFENCE is not a substitute for explicit testing with tools
# such as KASAN. KFENCE can detect a subset of bugs that KASAN can
# detect, albeit at very different performance profiles. If you can
# afford to use KASAN, continue using KASAN, for example in test
# environments. If your kernel targets production use, and cannot
# enable KASAN due to its cost, consider using KFENCE.
