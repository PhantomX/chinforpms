# CONFIG_DTPM_CPU:
# 
# This enables support for CPU power limitation based on
# energy model.
# Symbol: DTPM_CPU [=n]
# Type  : bool
# Defined at drivers/powercap/Kconfig:53
#   Prompt: Add CPU power capping based on the energy model
#   Depends on: POWERCAP [=y] && DTPM [=y] && ENERGY_MODEL [=y]
#   Location:
#     -> Device Drivers
#       -> Generic powercap sysfs driver (POWERCAP [=y])
#         -> Power capping for Dynamic Thermal Power Management (EXPERIMENTAL) (DTPM [=y])
