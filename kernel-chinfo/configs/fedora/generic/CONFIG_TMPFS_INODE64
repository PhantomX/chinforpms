# CONFIG_TMPFS_INODE64:
# 
# tmpfs has historically used only inode numbers as wide as an unsigned
# int. In some cases this can cause wraparound, potentially resulting
# in multiple files with the same inode number on a single device. This
# option makes tmpfs use the full width of ino_t by default, without
# needing to specify the inode64 option when mounting.
# 
# But if a long-lived tmpfs is to be accessed by 32-bit applications so
# ancient that opening a file larger than 2GiB fails with EINVAL, then
# the INODE64 config option and inode64 mount option risk operations
# failing with EOVERFLOW once 33-bit inode numbers are reached.
# 
# To override this configured default, use the inode32 or inode64
# option when mounting.
# 
# If unsure, say N.
