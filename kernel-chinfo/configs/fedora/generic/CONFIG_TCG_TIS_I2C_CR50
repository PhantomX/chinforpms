# CONFIG_TCG_TIS_I2C_CR50:
# 
# This is a driver for the Google cr50 I2C TPM interface which is a
# custom microcontroller and requires a custom i2c protocol interface
# to handle the limitations of the hardware.  To compile this driver
# as a module, choose M here; the module will be called tcg_tis_i2c_cr50.
