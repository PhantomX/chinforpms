# CONFIG_LEDS_LGM:
# 
# This option enables support for LEDs connected to GPIO lines on
# Lightning Mountain (LGM) SoC. Lightning Mountain is a AnyWAN
# gateway-on-a-chip SoC to be shipped on mid and high end home
# gateways and routers.
# 
# These LEDs are driven by a Serial Shift Output (SSO) controller.
# The driver supports hardware blinking and the LEDs can be configured
# to be triggered by software/CPU or by hardware.
# 
# Say 'Y' here if you are working on LGM SoC based platform. Otherwise,
# say 'N'. To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
# will be called leds-lgm-sso.
# 
# Symbol: LEDS_LGM [=n]
# Type  : tristate
# Defined at drivers/leds/blink/Kconfig:1
#   Prompt: LED support for LGM SoC series
