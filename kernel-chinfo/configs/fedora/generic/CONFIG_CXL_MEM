# CONFIG_CXL_MEM:
# 
# The CXL.mem protocol allows a device to act as a provider of
# "System RAM" and/or "Persistent Memory" that is fully coherent
# as if the memory was attached to the typical CPU memory
# controller.
# 
# Say 'y/m' to enable a driver (named "cxl_mem.ko" when built as
# a module) that will attach to CXL.mem devices for
# configuration, provisioning, and health monitoring. This
# driver is required for dynamic provisioning of CXL.mem
# attached memory which is a prerequisite for persistent memory
# support. Typically volatile memory is mapped by platform
# firmware and included in the platform memory map, but in some
# cases the OS is responsible for mapping that memory. See
# Chapter 2.3 Type 3 CXL Device in the CXL 2.0 specification.
# 
# If unsure say 'm'.
