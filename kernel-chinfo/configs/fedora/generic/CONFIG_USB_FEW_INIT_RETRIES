# CONFIG_USB_FEW_INIT_RETRIES:
# 
# When a new USB device is detected, the kernel tries very hard
# to initialize and enumerate it, with lots of nested retry loops.
# This almost always works, but when it fails it can take a long time.
# This option tells the kernel to make only a few retry attempts,
# so that the total time required for a failed initialization is
# no more than 30 seconds (as required by the USB OTG spec).
# 
# Say N here unless you require new-device enumeration failure to
# occur within 30 seconds (as might be needed in an embedded
# application).
# 
# Symbol: USB_FEW_INIT_RETRIES [=n]
