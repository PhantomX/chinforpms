# CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF_TOOLCHAIN_DEFAULT:
# 
# The implicit default version of DWARF debug info produced by a
# toolchain changes over time.
# 
# This can break consumers of the debug info that haven't upgraded to
# support newer revisions, and prevent testing newer versions, but
# those should be less common scenarios.
# 
# If unsure, say Y.
# 
# Symbol: DEBUG_INFO_DWARF_TOOLCHAIN_DEFAULT [=y]
# Type  : bool
# Defined at lib/Kconfig.debug:264
#   Prompt: Rely on the toolchain's implicit default DWARF version
