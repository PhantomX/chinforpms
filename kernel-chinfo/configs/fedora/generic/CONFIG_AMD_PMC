# CONFIG_AMD_PMC:
# 
# The driver provides support for AMD Power Management Controller
# primarily responsible for S2Idle transactions that are driven from
# a platform firmware running on SMU. This driver also provides a debug
# mechanism to investigate the S2Idle transactions and failures.
# 
# Say Y or M here if you have a notebook powered by AMD RYZEN CPU/APU.
# 
# If you choose to compile this driver as a module the module will be
# called amd-pmc.
