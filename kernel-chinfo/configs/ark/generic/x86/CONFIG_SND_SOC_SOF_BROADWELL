# CONFIG_SND_SOC_SOF_BROADWELL:
# 
# This adds support for Sound Open Firmware for Intel(R) platforms
# using the Broadwell processors.
# This option can coexist in the same build with the default 'catpt'
# driver.
# Existing firmware/topology binaries and UCM configurations typically
# located in the root file system are already compatible with both SOF
# or catpt drivers.
# SOF does not fully support Broadwell and has limitations related to
# DMA and suspend-resume, this is not a recommended option for
# distributions.
# Say Y if you want to enable SOF on Broadwell.
# If unsure select "N".
