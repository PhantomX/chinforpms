# CONFIG_CXL_MEM_RAW_COMMANDS:
# 
# Enable CXL RAW command interface.
# 
# The CXL driver ioctl interface may assign a kernel ioctl command
# number for each specification defined opcode. At any given point in
# time the number of opcodes that the specification defines and a device
# may implement may exceed the kernel's set of associated ioctl function
# numbers. The mismatch is either by omission, specification is too new,
# or by design. When prototyping new hardware, or developing / debugging
# the driver it is useful to be able to submit any possible command to
# the hardware, even commands that may crash the kernel due to their
# potential impact to memory currently in use by the kernel.
# 
# If developing CXL hardware or the driver say Y, otherwise say N.
